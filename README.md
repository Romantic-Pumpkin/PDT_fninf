# PDT_fninf
We proposed a hierarchical neuroscience knowledge base consisting of projects/organizations, multi-modal databases and toolkits to help researchers in cohort study, and developed and open sourced a query tool, for the knowledge base based on Python, PDT_fninf , so that researchers can quickly access the knowledge base.
