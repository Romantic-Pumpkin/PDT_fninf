# About PDT_fninf
In order to accelerate progress in cohort studies, we proposed a hierarchical neuroscience knowledge base consisting of projects/organizations, multi-modal databases and toolkits, and take the information object in Frontiers in Neuroscience as a example input. Meanwhile, we developed and open sourced the query tool, PDT_fninf , so that researchers can quickly access the knowledge base.
